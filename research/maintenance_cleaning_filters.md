# Kangen Water Machine Maintenance and Deep Cleaning Research

## Regular Maintenance

### Daily Maintenance
- Run Beauty Water 6.0 for 30 seconds daily
- This helps keep the electrolysis cell clean by reversing the electric current and removing mineral buildup

### Monthly Maintenance
- Perform an e-clean on your machine every 2-4 weeks to keep buildup off of your plates
