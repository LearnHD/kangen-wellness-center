# Kangen Water Benefits Research

## Understanding Kangen Water

Kangen water is a type of alkaline water produced by Enagic, a Japanese company specializing in water ionizer machines. The water is created through a process called electrolysis, which separates water into acidic and alkaline components using an ionization machine. Kangen water is the alkaline, ionized portion with a higher pH level, typically around 8 to 9.5, compared to regular tap water (pH around 7 or lower).

## Health Benefits of Kangen Water

### Enhanced Hydration
